      WARNING: this is not the recommended way to configure the underlying
      services that this charm installs and is used at the user's own risk.
      This option is mainly provided as a stop-gap for users that either
      want to test the effect of modifying some config or who have found
      a critical bug in the way the charm has configured their services
      and need it fixed immediately. We ask that whenever this is used,
      that the user consider opening a bug on this charm at
      http://bugs.launchpad.net/charms providing an explanation of why the
      config was needed so that we may consider it for inclusion as a
      natively supported config in the the charm.
  port:
    type: int
    default: 80
    description: |
      The port that the RADOS Gateway will listen on.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  pool-prefix:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The rados gateway stores objects in many different pools. If you would
      like to have multiple rados gateways each pointing to a separate set of
      pools set this prefix. The charm will then set up a new set of pools.
      If your prefix has a dash in it that will be used to split the prefix
      into region and zone. Please read the documentation on federated rados
      gateways for more information on region and zone.
  restrict-ceph-pools:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Optionally restrict Ceph key permissions to access pools as required.
  ceph-osd-replication-count:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any object
      it stores within RGW pools. Note that once the RGW pools have been
      created, changing this value will not have any effect (although it can be
      changed in ceph by manually configuring your ceph cluster).
  rgw-buckets-pool-weight:
    type: int
    default: 20
    description: |
      Defines a relative weighting of the pool as a percentage of the total
      amount of data in the Ceph cluster. This effectively weights the number
      of placement groups for the pool created to be appropriately portioned
      to the amount of data expected. For example, if the amount of data loaded
      into the RADOS Gateway/S3 interface is expected to be reserved for or
      consume 20% of the data in the Ceph cluster, then this value would be
      specified as 20.
  rgw-lightweight-pool-pg-num:
    type: int
    default: -1
    description: |
      When the Rados Gatway is installed it, by default, creates pools with
      pg_num 8 which, in the majority of cases is suboptimal. A few rgw pools
      tend to carry more data than others e.g. .rgw.buckets tends to be larger
      than most. So, for pools with greater requirements than others the charm
      will apply the optimal value i.e. corresponding to the number of OSDs
      up+in the cluster at the time the pool is created. For others it will use
      this value which can be altered depending on how big you cluster is. Note
      that once a pool has been created, changes to this setting will be
      ignored. Setting this value to -1, enables the number of placement
      groups to be calculated based on the Ceph placement group calculator.

  operator-roles:
    type: string
    default: "Member,Admin"
    description: |
