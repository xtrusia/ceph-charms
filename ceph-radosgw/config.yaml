      The last option should be used in conjunction with the key configuration
      option.

      Note that a minimum ceph version of 0.48.2 is required for use with this
      charm which is NOT provided by the packages in the main Ubuntu archive
      for precise but is provided in the Ubuntu cloud archive.

  use-ceph-optimised-packages:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      By default apache2 and libapache2-mod-fastcgi will be installed from the
      Ubuntu archives. This option allows for an alternate ceph.com install
      source which contains patched versions with added support for HTTP
      100-continue. See the following page for more info:

      http://ceph.com/docs/dumpling/radosgw/manual-install/#continue-support
  use-embedded-webserver:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Newer versions of the Ceph RADOS Gateway support use of an embedded web
      container instead of Apache + mod-fastcgi, avoiding some of the nuances
      of using the stock mod-fastcgi packages from Ubuntu.

      Enable this option to disable use of Apache and enable the embedded
      web container feature.
  vip:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Virtual IP(s) to use to front API services in HA configuration.

      If multiple networks are being used, a VIP should be provided for each
      network, separated by spaces.

    type: string
    default: eth0
    description: |
      Default network interface on which HA cluster will bind to communication
      with the other members of the HA Cluster.
  ha-mcastport:
    type: int
    default: 5414
    description: |
      Default multicast port number that will be used to communicate between
      HA Cluster nodes.
  os-public-hostname:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The hostname or address of the public endpoints created for ceph-radosgw
      in the keystone identity provider.

      This value will be used for public endpoints. For example, an
      os-public-hostname set to 'files.example.com' with will create
      the following public endpoint for the ceph-radosgw:

      https://files.example.com:80/swift/v1
  ceph-osd-replication-count:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any object
      it stores within RGW pools. Note that once the RGW pools have been
      created, changing this value will not have any effect (although it can be
      changed in ceph by manually configuring your ceph cluster).
  rgw-lightweight-pool-pg-num:
    type: int
    default: 64
    description: |
      When the Rados Gatway is installed it, by default, creates pools with
      pg_num 8 which, in the majority of cases is suboptimal. A few rgw pools
      tend to carry more data than others e.g. .rgw.buckets tends to be larger
      than most. So, for pools with greater requirements than others the charm
      will apply the optimal value i.e. corresponding to the number of OSDs
      up+in the cluster at the time the pool is created. For others it will use
      this value which can be altered depending on how big you cluster is. Note
      that once a pool has been created, changes to this setting will be
      ignored.
  haproxy-server-timeout:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
       Server timeout configuration in ms for haproxy, used in HA
       configurations. If not provided, default value of 30000ms is used.
  haproxy-client-timeout:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
       Client timeout configuration in ms for haproxy, used in HA
       configurations. If not provided, default value of 30000ms is used.
  haproxy-queue-timeout:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
       Queue timeout configuration in ms for haproxy, used in HA
       configurations. If not provided, default value of 5000ms is used.
  haproxy-connect-timeout:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
       Connect timeout configuration in ms for haproxy, used in HA
       configurations. If not provided, default value of 5000ms is used.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  pool-prefix:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The rados gateway stores objects in many different pools.  If you would
      like to have multiple rados gateways each pointing to a separate set of
      pools set this prefix.  The charm will then set up a new set of pools.
      If your prefix has a dash in it that will be used to split the prefix
      into region and zone.  Please read the documentation on federated rados
      gateways for more information on region and zone.
  nagios_context:
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
